# Patchthrough

Record the meeting. We'll patch you through to your agent.

Patchthrough is a macOS menu-bar app that records your meetings. It transcribes them
**entirely on-device**, then gives the transcript to the coding agent you use. It
records your microphone and the other side of the call as two separate tracks. The
agent starts as a primed session in the repository you discussed. Patchthrough
supports Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Kimi, opencode, and cursor-agent.

Nothing leaves your machine. There is no account, no server, and no upload. The
handoff is the product. One click takes you from *"we agreed on it in the meeting"* to
*"an agent is implementing it with the transcript in context"*.

```
┌─ meeting ─────────┐   ┌─ on-device ─────────┐   ┌─ your agent ──────────────┐
│ your mic     ──►  │   │ two-track           │   │ claude / copilot / codex  │

│ (the other side)  │   │ me/them diarization │   │ primed with the transcript │
└───────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘   └───────────────────────────┘
```

## How it works

1. **Click Patchthrough in the menu bar, then click Start recording.** Patchthrough
   captures your microphone and everything the Mac plays as two separate CAF tracks.
   Two tracks are deliberate. Speech models work better on clean single-source audio.
   The two tracks also give you two-party diarization, `me` against `them`, with no
   speaker-identification model.
2. **Click Stop.** Transcription starts automatically and stays on-device. Standard
   mode uses the best corpus-qualified engine for the machine. Max Accuracy may run
   two complementary engines sequentially, but only after the checked-in release
   gates prove at least a 10% WER gain over the best single engine. The safe default
   remains Parakeet until that evidence exists.
3. **In the menu bar, click Patch through to, then click claude.** The menu lists every
   agent that Patchthrough finds on your machine. Select the project folder. A terminal
   opens in that folder with the agent running and the transcript staged. You can also
   run this command inside the repository:

   ```sh
   patchthrough hand claude
   ```

The agent gets the verbatim transcript, not a summary. This is deliberate. A lossy
summary is where requirements get dropped quietly. Patchthrough adds a prompt with the
transcript. The prompt tells the agent to extract work items, decisions, and
ambiguities, to ask you before it guesses at a garbled term, and to change no code
until you agree the plan.

## Notes

While a meeting records, you can type notes in the Patchthrough window. Each one is
stamped against the recording, so a note taken at 2:14 points at the line the transcript
labels `[2:14]`.

Notes ride into the handoff in their own section, above the transcript. Nothing
generates them, nothing rewrites them, and nothing summarizes them — they are your own
words, and the transcript below them is still verbatim. A transcript records what was
said; it has no way of knowing which two minutes of it you actually cared about. That is
what the notes are for, and it is why the agent is told to prioritise by them and still
treat the transcript as the record.

Notes are optional. A session where you typed nothing produces no notes section at all.

The transcript lands in `.meeting/` inside your repository. Patchthrough adds
`.meeting/` to the repository's **local** git excludes. Meeting content cannot reach a
commit by accident, and Patchthrough does not touch your `.gitignore`.

## Platform support

Patchthrough ships two programs. They share one file format and nothing else.

| | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Record and transcribe | yes, macOS 15+, Apple Silicon | milestone 1 console recorder; hardware acceptance pending | no |
| Hand a transcript to an agent (the CLI) | yes | yes | yes |
| Hand a transcript to a chat site (the CLI) | yes | yes | no |

The macOS recorder is released today. The Windows recorder is implemented in this
repository, and CI produces installable unsigned previews, but it remains a preview
until its physical-hardware checklist passes. The CLI runs anywhere Node.js runs, and
it reads any session that follows the
[session v1 contract](schemas/session-v1.md). A recorder for another platform therefore
needs no change to the CLI.

## Install the macOS app

[Download Patchthrough-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/nico-herrera/patchthrough/releases/latest/download/Patchthrough-arm64.dmg),
open it, and drag Patchthrough into Applications. Patchthrough Settings has an option
to launch the app at login.

Patchthrough then updates itself. It asks GitHub for the newest release about twice a
day, and the menu bar offers to install one when it finds it. Nothing installs without
a click, and nothing installs during a recording. Before it replaces anything, the app
checks that the download carries the same Developer ID signature, the same team, and
the same bundle identifier as the copy you are running, and that Apple notarized it.
Settings turns the checks off. See [docs/updates.md](docs/updates.md).

Apple notarizes each release, and each release is signed with Developer ID and
published with a SHA-256 checksum. Releases therefore open on a normal double-click.
This open-source project ships directly through GitHub instead of the Mac App Store.
Developer ID is Apple's supported path for that kind of distribution.

macOS 15 removed the old right-click → **Open** bypass for unsigned apps. If you build
an unsigned copy yourself, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find the
blocked-app notice, and click **Open Anyway**.

To build from source instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nico-herrera/patchthrough
cd patchthrough
./packaging/make-app.sh                  # builds and installs to ~/Applications
```

`~/Applications` needs no `sudo`. The app bundle gives macOS a stable name, icon,
signature, and permission identity.

**Requires:** macOS 15 or later, because system-audio capture uses Core Audio process
taps. Apple Silicon is also required, because transcription runs on the Neural Engine.
The models are about 600 MB and download once on the first transcription. Record a
short test session while you are online, before your first real meeting.

## Command-line client

The npm package is a separate transcript client that runs on any platform. It does not
download or install the macOS app, and it has no install scripts:

```sh
npm i -g patchthrough
```

```sh
patchthrough hand [agent]           # hand the newest transcript to an agent, here
patchthrough hand claude -s <session> -d <repo> -n
patchthrough transcripts            # list sessions: length, status, first line
patchthrough hand codex --file meeting.md
patchthrough hand --web claude      # open a chat site, transcript on the clipboard
```

`--web claude`, `--web chatgpt`, `--web m365`, and any id from `custom_destinations` need
macOS or Windows, because they use the system clipboard. They need no repository and no
installed app. One paste attaches the transcript: ⌘V on macOS, Ctrl+V on Windows. The CLI
cannot paste for you as reliably as the app can: macOS gives Accessibility to the terminal
that runs the command, not to Patchthrough, so without that grant the CLI tells you to
paste instead of pretending it did. Windows never pastes for you, because a synthesized
keystroke there has no reliable focus guarantee.

The CLI reads the sessions that the app writes. It also accepts any transcript file or
input on stdin, so you can use the CLI without the app. See [`cli/`](cli/) for the full
CLI documentation. If you upgrade from npm package 1.x, your installed app and your
recordings stay in place. The upgrade only replaces the old wrapper command with the
new CLI.

Sessions land in `~/Recordings/<yyyy.MM.dd-HHmm>/`. Each session holds the original
two audio tracks, `meta.json`, `transcript.raw.json` with every recoverable engine
hypothesis and timed word, additive `transcript.json`, and readable `transcript.md`.

Optional config at `~/.config/patchthrough/config.json`:

```json
{
  "recordings_dir": "~/Recordings",
  "transcription": { "enabled": true, "engine": "auto",
                     "quality_mode": "standard",
                     "project_dir": "~/Developer/my-project",
                     "dedup_mic_echo": true },
  "mic_voice_processing": false,
  "on_stop": "my-hook"
}
```

`quality_mode` is `standard` or `max_accuracy`. Both obey the model and processing
budgets in [`quality/README.md`](quality/README.md). `project_dir` supplies bounded
spellings from glossaries and project metadata; terms are recorded as applied only
when acoustic confidence supports them. `dedup_mic_echo` removes mic speech only when
at least 80% of timed words match a nearby, higher-confidence system track. Set it to
`false` to keep every canonical segment; raw hypotheses are always retained.

`on_stop` runs any command and passes the finished session directory as the argument.
Use it for summarization, filing, indexing, or any other step that follows the
transcript.

## Agents

Patchthrough detects two kinds of destination automatically.

**Terminal sessions.** Patchthrough looks for agent CLIs in the usual install
locations: `claude`, `copilot`, `codex`, `kimi`, `opencode`, and `cursor-agent`. Most
agents launch as `<agent> "<prompt>"`. opencode uses `opencode run`. kimi takes no
initial prompt, so Patchthrough stages the prompt on your clipboard.

**GUI apps.** Run `patchthrough hand <target> --gui`, or start the handoff from the
menu bar. Each app gets the best entry point that the app exposes:

| target | how the handoff lands |
|---|---|
| `copilot` | VS Code opens through `code chat` in agent mode, with the transcript attached as context |
| `cursor` | Cursor opens the repository, and the prompt arrives through the `cursor://` deeplink (clipboard fallback) |
| `claude` | The Claude app opens a **new chat** through its `claude://` deeplink, instructions prefilled. The handoff file goes to the clipboard, and the paste attaches it |
| `claude-code` | The Claude app opens a **new Claude Code session** in the repo you pick. The transcript stages at `.meeting/<session>.md` (kept out of commits), and the prompt points at it. No clipboard involved |
| `codex` | The ChatGPT app opens. The handoff file goes to the clipboard, and the paste attaches it |
| `kimi` | The Kimi app opens with the same clipboard payload |
| `m365-copilot` | The Microsoft 365 Copilot app opens with the prompt and transcript on the clipboard as **text**. Its composer ignores file pastes and synthesized keystrokes, so paste (⌘V) yourself |
| `web-claude` | claude.ai opens a new chat in your browser with the prompt prefilled. The paste attaches the transcript |
| `web-chatgpt` | chatgpt.com opens the same way |
| `web-m365` | m365.cloud.microsoft opens a new chat. This is the only way to attach a file to M365 Copilot, because the desktop app drops one. **Microsoft copies the attachment to your work OneDrive**, so Patchthrough asks first |

**Name a meeting.** A folder timestamp is a poor title. Right-click a session in the
window and choose Rename to give it one. The name goes in that session's `meta.json`, so
it survives a restart, and the handoff document uses it as its title, which gives the
agent something better than `2026.07.30-2145` to refer to.

**Your own destinations.** Any web app with a chat box that accepts a pasted file can be
a destination. Add one in Settings under **Your destinations**, or write it into
`custom_destinations` in the config. Either way it appears under **Custom** in the
patch-through menu, on your machine only:

```json
{
  "custom_destinations": [
    { "id": "internal-tool", "label": "Internal tool",
      "url": "https://tool.example.com/chat",
      "prefills_prompt": true, "uploads_to_cloud": false }
  ]
}
```

`id` accepts letters, numbers, and `. _ -`. `url` must start with `http://` or
`https://`: the URL goes to `open`, which hands any other scheme to whatever app claims
it. Set `prefills_prompt` to false for a site that ignores a `q` query item, and
`uploads_to_cloud` to true for one that copies attachments off your machine, which makes
Patchthrough ask before each handoff. Patchthrough reports and skips an entry it cannot
use. The npm CLI reads the same list: `patchthrough hand --web internal-tool`.

**Web destinations** need no installed app, only a browser. They put `handoff.md` on the
clipboard as a file, open the site, and one paste attaches it. Patchthrough pastes into
whichever browser macOS opens, and waits longer than it does for an app, because the
page has to load first. A site that interrupts with a banner can swallow the paste; the
file stays on the clipboard, so press ⌘V again.

The web prompt never names the file. chatgpt.com renames a pasted file to a random
identifier and drops the extension, so an instruction to read `handoff.md` would send
the agent looking for a file it cannot see.

The Claude CLI is a separate destination. It is `claude` **without** `--gui`, and the
menu calls it **Claude Code**.

ChatGPT and Kimi expose no prompt API, and the Claude chat composer only takes text.
For those, the clipboard carries the `handoff.md` file itself, so the paste attaches
it like a drag would. The file is self-contained: instructions first, then the
verbatim transcript. An attachment scales to any meeting length, where inline text
would drown the input box. Patchthrough completes the paste for you: it synthesizes
⌘N and ⌘V after the app opens (⌘V only for Claude, whose deeplink already opened the
new chat), and you still press send. macOS asks for Accessibility permission once.
Without that permission, Patchthrough tells you to paste yourself. To always paste
manually, add `"auto_paste": false` to the config.

The Patchthrough window is the universal entry point. Open it from the menu bar. Every
session in the window has a **drag chip**. Drag the transcript file into any chat
input, including the input of an app that Patchthrough has no button for. The generated
`handoff.md` is self-contained. It carries both the instructions for the agent and the
verbatim transcript, so a dragged or attached file keeps the instructions.

To add an agent or a GUI target, add one entry to
`Sources/patchthrough/Handoff.swift`.

## Trust

The transcript of your meetings is about as sensitive as data gets. The supply-chain
posture is therefore deliberate:

- **Everything on-device.** Audio, transcripts, and the handoff never touch a network.
  The only downloads are the transcription models. FluidAudio fetches them once from
  HuggingFace.
- **Exact dependency pins.** Patchthrough pins swift-argument-parser, FluidAudio, and
  WhisperKit with `.exact()`. No version range
  can pull unreviewed code into a binary that has microphone access. Windows uses
  exact NuGet ranges plus checked-in lock files for every direct and transitive
  package, and normal restores run in locked mode.
- **Reviewed baselines.** `packaging/verify-deps.sh` fails the build in three cases:
  the resolved dependencies drift from the committed baseline, the compiled checkout
  does not match the lockfile, or a dependency checkout has local modifications.
  Runtime SHA-256 verification covers every downloaded Core ML artifact before load;
  Windows verifies pinned archives/models and checks an extracted-file manifest before
  inference. `models/registry.json` is the reviewed source, version, size, and hash list.
- **No npm install scripts.** The npm package is plain JavaScript. It never downloads
  or executes a native binary during installation.
- **Documented handoff contract.** The app and the CLI communicate through the
  versioned session files that
  [`schemas/session-v1.md`](schemas/session-v1.md) documents.
- **Small native app bundle.** The executable, Info.plist, icon, and required assets
  live in a normal signed macOS bundle. Dock identity and TCC permissions therefore
  stay attached to Patchthrough.

## Gotchas

- A global tap records **everything** the Mac plays. This includes notification sounds
  and music. Do not play anything that you do not want in the transcript.
- A silent recording usually means one thing: System Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Screen & System Audio Recording is off for patchthrough.
- Parakeet transcribes English only.
- Expect transcription errors on proper nouns and identifiers. The handoff prompt warns
  the agent about exactly this.
- Use headphones for the best speaker labels. On speakers, your mic also hears the other
  person. Patchthrough removes the duplicated text, but speech it caught only through
  the mic still carries the `me` label.

## Releases

The app and the CLI share this repository and the session-file contract, but they
release independently:

- `./packaging/make-dist.sh <version>` builds the signed disk image.
  `./packaging/notarize.sh` then notarizes and staples the disk image before you attach
  it to a GitHub release.
- **The release tag must match the version exactly.** `make-dist.sh 1.7.0` needs tag
  `v1.7.0`. The installed app compares the two and refuses an update when they disagree.
  See [docs/updates.md](docs/updates.md).
- `windows\packaging\build-release.ps1 -Version <version>` builds the self-contained
  Windows x64 ZIP and per-user installer. CI exercises the full install and uninstall
  flow, but its artifacts are unsigned previews. Pass `-CertificateThumbprint` for a
  public build, and do not publish it as supported until
  [`docs/windows-hardware-acceptance.md`](docs/windows-hardware-acceptance.md) passes.
- `cd cli && npm publish` publishes the JavaScript CLI. CLI releases use tags such as
  `cli-v2.0.0`. App releases keep `v1.0.2`-style tags.

If you change `schemas/session-v1.md`, add compatibility coverage to the CLI tests. Add
a fallback for the sessions that older app versions wrote.

## Credits

Patchthrough began as a detached rebuild of
[quill](https://github.com/digimata/quill) by digimata. The recording and transcription
core descends from quill (MIT, see LICENSE). Transcription uses
[Parakeet TDT](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2) through
[FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)'s Core ML port.

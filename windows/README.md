# Windows recorder

Read [`schemas/session-v1.md`](../schemas/session-v1.md) first. That contract is
the whole interface between a recorder and everything downstream.

## State

Milestone 1 is partly built. Be careful about what is verified here.

| Part | State | Verified how |
|---|---|---|
| Session format: meta.json, transcript.raw.json, transcript.json, transcript.md, handoff.md | done | unit tests and `verify-contract.sh` read a generated session with the real npm CLI |
| Silence padding arithmetic | done | unit tests, including a two-hour gap |
| Transcript line breaks | done | unit tests against the rules in ParakeetEngine.swift |
| Audio capture through WASAPI | written | **compiles only.** It has never run |
| AAC encoding through Media Foundation | written | **compiles only.** It has never run |
| Parakeet through sherpa-onnx | written | compiles and model-free tests pass; hardware/model smoke is scheduled/manual |
| Whisper Large v3 Turbo Q5 through Whisper.net | written | compiles; probes Vulkan, CPU, then CPU-no-AVX; hardware/model smoke pending |
| Model download | done in code | resumable and pinned SHA-256 verification; real Windows download/load pending |
| Portable ZIP and per-user installer | done in code | Windows CI builds the self-contained x64 directory, installs it, runs the console tool, uninstalls it, and verifies SHA-256 files |
| Authenticode signature | wired, not credentialed | release script signs the app and installer when given a certificate thumbprint; no public certificate is configured yet |
| Session list, config writer, transcription queue | done | unit tests on any platform, including a macOS run |
| Recording, transcription and doctor as services | written | **compiles only.** The console verbs call the same code, so a hardware run exercises it |
| Tray application and window | written | **compiles only.** Windows CI renders every pane to PNG; the layout has not been reviewed on a real display yet |
| Patch through: agents, chat sites, staging, clipboard | written | staging, prompts, destinations and agent discovery are unit tested; launching needs a Windows run |
| Notes during a meeting, and `audio_start` | done | unit tested, and `verify-contract.sh` rebuilds the document with the real npm CLI and compares it byte for byte |

The hardware rows remain the risk. A cross-compiled Windows binary and model-free
tests prove APIs and contracts, not capture, codecs, GPU selection, or inference on a
real Windows device. A public Windows release stays a preview until
[`../docs/windows-hardware-acceptance.md`](../docs/windows-hardware-acceptance.md)
is complete.

`Patchthrough.Core` targets `net8.0` and holds everything that does not need
Windows, so the session format stays testable on any machine. That split is
deliberate: the format is the part that must be right, and it is the part a Mac
can check.

`Patchthrough.Windows` targets `net8.0-windows` and holds the audio. It builds
on macOS and Linux through `EnableWindowsTargeting`, which type-checks every
call into NAudio. A compile is not a run. Nobody has yet confirmed that this
code captures a single sample.

`Patchthrough.App` targets `net8.0-windows` and holds the window and the tray
icon. It builds on macOS and Linux too, XAML included, through the same
`EnableWindowsTargeting`. It references `Patchthrough.Windows`, so publishing the
app emits both executables into one directory.

Both Windows projects are driven through services rather than through the console
entry point: `RecordingService`, `SessionTranscriber`, `TranscriptionQueue`,
`SessionIndex`, and `DoctorReport`. The console verbs and the window call the same
code, so a hardware run of `rec` exercises what the tray button does.

## Build and check

```sh
cd windows
dotnet test              # the session format and the padding arithmetic
./verify-contract.sh     # writes a session, then reads it with the npm CLI
```

`verify-contract.sh` is the interesting one. It generates a session with the
real `Patchthrough.Core` code path and hands it to `cli/bin/patchthrough.js`,
which is the definition of done for milestone 1.

## Build the Windows packages

On Windows, install Inno Setup 6 or 7 and run:

```powershell
windows\packaging\build-release.ps1 -Version 1.4.0
windows\packaging\verify-release.ps1 -ExpectedVersion 1.4.0
```

The release build uses locked NuGet dependency graphs and produces a self-contained
directory holding both executables. A user does not need to install .NET. The output is:

```text
dist\Patchthrough-windows-x64.zip
dist\Patchthrough-windows-x64.zip.sha256
dist\Patchthrough-windows-x64-setup.exe
dist\Patchthrough-windows-x64-setup.exe.sha256
```

The installer is x64, per-user, and does not ask for administrator access. It installs
under the current user's Programs directory, registers `Patchthrough.exe`, and offers
to add the install directory to the user's `PATH`. The verifier exercises the portable
executable plus the full install/run/uninstall path on Windows CI. The packaged build
requires an x64-compatible Windows 10 version 1809 or later, or Windows 11.

CI artifacts are unsigned previews. For a public build, import the Authenticode
certificate into the current user's certificate store and pass its thumbprint:

```powershell
windows\packaging\build-release.ps1 -Version 1.4.0 `
  -CertificateThumbprint $env:PATCHTHROUGH_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT
```

The script signs and verifies both `Patchthrough.exe` and the installer with SHA-256
and a trusted timestamp. Do not publish those artifacts as supported Windows builds
until the physical-hardware checklist also passes.

## Use

```
Patchthrough rec [--out <dir>] [--name <title>]   record a meeting
Patchthrough transcribe [--out <dir>]             transcribe what is pending
Patchthrough doctor [--out <dir>]                 check this machine
Patchthrough benchmark --audio <file> --engine parakeet|whisper [--quality standard|max_accuracy]
```

`rec` records until Ctrl+C or Enter, then transcribes. A failed transcription
leaves the audio and meta.json in place, so `transcribe` retries it.

Set `transcription.quality_mode` in the shared config to `standard` or
`max_accuracy`. Windows keeps both modes on the recoverable Parakeet path unless
`~/.config/patchthrough/quality-profile.json` contains release-qualified evidence
from a corrected corpus for another engine. An unqualified profile cannot silently enable
Whisper or dual-engine consensus; see
[`../docs/engine-selection.md`](../docs/engine-selection.md).

The explicitly selected model downloads on first use into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\patchthrough\models`. Partial files resume. Patchthrough checks the
registered byte length and SHA-256 before installing/loading, securely extracts the
Parakeet archive, and revalidates installed files on later launches. `doctor` reports
what will download without treating a not-yet-cached model as a broken machine.

## What is left in milestone 1

Every remaining item needs a physical Windows machine with real audio hardware.

1. Run `Patchthrough doctor`. It should find the devices and the model.
2. Record a meeting. Confirm both tracks hold audio.
3. Record three minutes and play audio only in the middle minute. Confirm the
   two tracks stay aligned, which is what the silence padding exists for. This
   is the failure most likely to survive into a release, because it produces a
   plausible transcript with wrong times rather than an error.
4. Confirm `patchthrough hand claude` on the same machine hands the session off.

## What a Windows recorder has to do

It records two tracks, transcribes them on the machine, and writes a session
directory. It does not need to know about agents, prompts, or the CLI.

The definition of done for the first milestone is one sentence: the npm CLI on
Windows runs `patchthrough transcripts` and `patchthrough hand claude` against
a session this recorder wrote, with no change to the CLI.

That means:

- One directory for each session, named `yyyy.MM.dd-HHmm`.
- `meta.json` with `duration_seconds`, `clean_stop`, and a `files` map that
  names each audio track. Write it when recording starts, so a crash leaves a
  recoverable marker, then rewrite it on stop. A `name` key is optional, and it
  holds a title the user gave the meeting.
- `transcript.md`, where each spoken segment starts with
  `**[timestamp] speaker:**`. The speakers are `me` and `them`.
- `handoff.md`, generated immediately after the transcript.
- Atomic writes. A reader must never see a half-written file.

The audio container is free. The contract names no extension, and the CLI opens
no audio file.

## Decided stack

| Concern | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | C# on .NET 8 | Best access to WASAPI, the tray, and a self-contained publish |
| Projects | `Patchthrough.Core` (net8.0), `Patchthrough.Windows` (net8.0-windows), `Patchthrough.App` (net8.0-windows) | Core stays testable on any platform. `Patchthrough.Windows` holds the audio and the console tool. `Patchthrough.App` holds the window |
| Executables | `Patchthrough.exe` console, `PatchthroughApp.exe` window, one shared directory | A console executable flashes a console window at sign-in. A graphical one does not hold a shell, so `rec` and Ctrl+C stop working from a terminal. Neither compromise is needed: publishing the app emits both, sharing one runtime |
| Audio | NAudio: `WasapiCapture` and `WasapiLoopbackCapture` | Maintained, and it wraps the APIs this needs |
| Container | AAC in MP4 through Media Foundation | Same codec the macOS app already writes |
| Transcription | sherpa-onnx with Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2, int8 | Same model family as macOS, and it returns token timings |
| UI | WPF with a tray icon | WinUI 3 has no first-class tray icon |
| Config | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\patchthrough\config.json` | The CLI reads that path on every platform. Two paths would split the state of one machine |
| Launch at login | `HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run` | Per user, no administrator, and visible in Task Manager |
| Install | Inno Setup, per user, plus a plain zip | No administrator, and no MSIX identity to fight |

## Milestones

1. **A session the CLI can read.** Console only, no window. Two-track capture,
   transcription, and a valid session directory. Ships as a zip.
2. **The tray app.** Start and stop, recording state, a sessions window, and
   settings. The services under it are built and tested; the interface is being
   built on top of them.
3. **Handoffs.** Agents through Windows Terminal, the clipboard, and chat sites.
   Built. Windows never auto-pastes: a synthesized keystroke has no reliable focus
   guarantee here, so the user pastes and the status line says so. The npm CLI
   refuses for the same reason.
4. **Distribution.** The portable ZIP and per-user installer are implemented,
   with a Start menu entry and an optional start at sign-in. Authenticode
   credentials, public release publication, and self-exclusion from the loopback
   capture remain.

## Risks to design for, not to discover

**Loopback capture goes silent.** WASAPI delivers no buffer at all while
nothing plays. A recorder that only writes the buffers it receives produces a
system track shorter than the microphone track, and every timestamp after the
first silence is wrong. Pad the gaps against the wall clock. Test it: record
two minutes, and play audio only in the middle minute.

**The transcription models are large.** They are about 600 MB and download
once. Verify them against a recorded hash, the way `packaging/verify-models.sh`
does for macOS.

**Windows N editions have no AAC encoder.** Report it in the doctor check, and
fall back to PCM in WAV. The `files` map makes that legal.

**Echo cancellation is off by default on macOS.** Match that. The handoff
prompt already warns that a `me` or `them` label can be wrong.

**A device change kills a stream.** A Bluetooth headset that connects mid
meeting ends the capture. Handle it, or say so in the doctor check.

## Shared prose

The handoff prompts exist three times, in `Sources/patchthrough/Handoff.swift`,
in `cli/src/patchthrough.js`, and in
`windows/src/Patchthrough.Core/HandoffDocument.cs` plus
`windows/src/Patchthrough.Core/HandoffPrompt.cs`. All of them carry a comment
that says to keep them in step. `HandoffPrompt` holds the two prompts that travel
with a handoff rather than inside the document: the one an agent reads in a
repository, and the one a chat composer receives with the file attached.

The `## Notes` section now exists on every platform. The Windows side is
`SessionNotes.cs` plus `HandoffDocument.NotesSection`, and `verify-contract.sh`
rebuilds the document with the real npm CLI from the same session and compares it
byte for byte, so a wording drift in either renderer fails the build rather than
shipping.

Exactly one wording differs on purpose. The macOS and CLI copies say "the audio the
Mac played" in the speakers line, which is false in a document this recorder wrote,
so the Windows text says "this machine" instead. `verify-contract.sh` asserts both
halves of that exception, so it cannot quietly widen into a real divergence.
